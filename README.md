# Data Science Portfolio (R & Python)

This repository contains academic and practical projects in **R** and **Python**,  
covering linear regression, time series forecasting, panel data analysis, and machine learning.  
The goal is to demonstrate data analysis, model building, and evaluation skills.

## 1. NVDA Time Series Forecasting (ARMA)

### Methods
- Data exploration and visualization across multiple years
- Stationarity check (ADF test)
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation analysis (ACF/PACF)
- ARMA model selection (based on AIC)
- Forecast evaluation with RMSE and MAE

### Files
- `NVDA_ARMA_Forecast.R` – R script containing the full workflow  
- `data_nvda.csv` – dataset with NVDA stock daily prices (source: Yahoo Finance)  
- `plots/` – saved figures of diagnostics and forecasts  

### Key Outcomes
- Identified changes and trends in NVDA stock across years  
- Selected the optimal ARMA model for forecasting  
- Generated forecasts and compared them to actual values with visual plots

## 2. Fixed Effects Model (Panel Data)

### Methods
- Panel data setup with multiple entities observed across time  
- Fixed Effects regression model to control for individual heterogeneity  
- Comparison of model results with alternative specifications  

### File
- `Fixed_Effects_Model.R` – R script implementing the Fixed Effects regression  

### Key Outcomes
- Demonstrated how Fixed Effects isolate within-unit variation over time  
- Evaluated the relationship between explanatory variables and the dependent variable while controlling for unit-level effects

## 4. Linear Regression — Car Price Prediction (Python)

### Methods
- Data cleaning: removal of duplicates and outliers  
- Exploratory visualization: histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmap  
- Feature engineering: interaction terms  
- Model fitting with `statsmodels` (OLS)  
- Evaluation with RMSE and R²; residual diagnostics and Actual vs. Predicted comparison  

### File
- `Car_Price_Linear_Regression.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow  

### Key Outcomes
- Built and validated a linear regression model to predict car prices  
- Achieved high model accuracy (R² ≈ 0.99, RMSE ≈ 94.7)
